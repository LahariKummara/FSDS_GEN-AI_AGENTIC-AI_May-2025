      "## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it as making computers smart like humans.** AI is about teaching computers to do things that normally require human intelligence, like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Learning:** Understanding new information.\n",
      "*   **Problem-solving:** Figuring out solutions.\n",
      "*   **Decision-making:** Choosing what to do.\n",
      "*   **Understanding language:** Reading and speaking.\n",
      "*   **Recognizing things:** Seeing and identifying objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** AI is when computers can think, learn, and act in ways that seem intelligent.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. What is Generative AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "**This is AI that can *create* new things.** Instead of just analyzing or answering questions, Generative AI can make its own content. This content can be:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Text:** Writing stories, poems, or emails.\n",
      "*   **Images:** Drawing pictures or making art.\n",
      "*   **Music:** Composing melodies.\n",
      "*   **Code:** Writing computer programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** Generative AI is like a creative artist or writer for computers, making brand new stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. What is Agentic AI?\n",
      "\n",
      "**This is AI that can *act* on its own to achieve a goal.** Think of it like a digital assistant that doesn't just wait for instructions, but can figure out the steps needed to complete a task and then carry them out. It can:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Plan:** Decide on a sequence of actions.\n",
      "*   **Execute:** Perform those actions.\n",
      "*   **Learn from experience:** Adjust its plan if something goes wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** Agentic AI is AI that can take initiative and work independently to get things done.\n",
